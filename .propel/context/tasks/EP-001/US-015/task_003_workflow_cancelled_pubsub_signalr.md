# TASK-003: Create `api-gateway/app/services/cancellation_dispatcher.py` — Publish `WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` Pub/Sub Event & Broadcast SignalR Notification (Post-Commit Background Tasks)

> **Story:** US-015 | **Epic:** EP-001 | **Sprint:** 2 | **Layer:** Backend | **Est:** 2 h
> **Status:** Done | **Date:** 2026-07-22

## Context

US-015 Technical Notes specify two side effects that must run **after** the database transaction commits — not inside it:

> *"SignalR notification dispatched via async background task after transaction commits (do not block MLLP ACK)"*
> *"A11 should also publish a `WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` event to Pub/Sub so the agent framework (EP-003) can drain its own in-flight tasks"*

And Scenario 1 requires:

> *"a SignalR notification is broadcast to care team dashboard users"*

Running these side effects outside the transaction boundary is correct for two reasons:

1. **Transaction isolation:** If the Pub/Sub publish or SignalR call fails, the DB transaction (encounter status revert + task cancellations) must not be rolled back — the cancellation is already durably recorded.
2. **MLLP ACK timeliness:** The HL7 listener's MLLP ACK must not be held open waiting for SignalR or Pub/Sub latency. Both are dispatched as FastAPI `BackgroundTask` entries after the HTTP response (ACK) is sent (AIR-001: "MLLP ACK within 200ms").

`CancellationDispatcher` encapsulates both side effects:

1. **Pub/Sub `WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` event** — published to `adt-events` topic with a special `message_type=WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` attribute. The Coordinator Agent (EP-003) subscribes to this attribute filter to drain any in-flight LLM or tool calls for the affected encounter.

2. **SignalR broadcast** — pushed to the `encounter-{encounter_id}` group with payload `{event: ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED, encounter_id, event_type, reason}` (Scenario 1 DoD requirement).

Design decisions:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Separate `CancellationDispatcher` from `CancellationService` | `CancellationService` (TASK-001) owns DB state; dispatcher owns external side effects. Separation simplifies unit testing: service tests mock dispatcher, dispatcher tests mock Pub/Sub SDK and SignalR hub |
| `dispatch_post_commit()` async method | Called after `await session.commit()` in the API handler; never called inside the `async with session.begin()` block |
| Pub/Sub `message_type=WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` attribute | Allows coordinator agent subscription to filter-match this event type specifically, without deserialising the full message body |
| `encounter_id` ordering key on `WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` | Same ordering key as standard ADT events (ADR-001); preserves FIFO per encounter in Pub/Sub |
| `ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED` SignalR event name | Care team dashboard subscribes to this event name to display cancellation banner; payload schema version-pinned |
| `asyncio.gather` for Pub/Sub + SignalR | Both are independent I/O operations; run concurrently to minimise total post-commit latency |

Design refs: ADR-001, AIR-001, FR-006, NFR-006 (<1s SignalR latency), TR-015, US-015 Technical Notes.

## Acceptance Criteria Addressed

| US-015 AC | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Scenario 1** | SignalR notification broadcast to care team dashboard with `{event: ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED, encounter_id, reason}` |
| **DoD (Pub/Sub)** | `WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` event published to Pub/Sub (Technical Notes) |
| **DoD (no block)** | Notification dispatched as async background task — does not block MLLP ACK path |

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Scaffold the dispatcher

```
api-gateway/
└── app/
    └── services/
        └── cancellation_dispatcher.py   ← THIS TASK
```

### 2. Create `api-gateway/app/services/cancellation_dispatcher.py`

```python
"""Post-commit dispatcher for ADT cancellation side effects.

Publishes a ``WORKFLOW_CANCELLED`` Pub/Sub event and broadcasts a SignalR
``ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED`` notification after the database transaction for an
ADT cancellation event (A11, A12, or A13) has committed successfully.

IMPORTANT: This module must NEVER be called inside a database transaction.
The dispatcher performs best-effort I/O; failures are logged but do not
roll back the committed DB state.

Pub/Sub message spec (``WORKFLOW_CANCELLED``):
  topic     : adt-events  (same topic as all ADT events — ADR-001)
  ordering_key: str(encounter_id)
  attributes:
    message_type   = "WORKFLOW_CANCELLED"
    event_type     = "A11" | "A12" | "A13"
    encounter_id   = str(UUID)
    iso_timestamp  = ISO-8601 UTC string
  body      : UTF-8 JSON — {"encounter_id": str, "event_type": str,
                             "tasks_cancelled": int, "docs_cancelled": int}

SignalR payload spec (``ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED``):
  group     : "encounter-{encounter_id}"
  event     : "ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED"
  payload   :
    { "event": "ENCOUNTER_CANCELLED",
      "encounter_id": str(UUID),
      "event_type": "A11" | "A12" | "A13",
      "reason": "Cancellation event {event_type} received" }

PHI safety (BR-020):
  Neither the Pub/Sub message attributes nor the SignalR payload contain
  PHI fields (patient name, MRN, DOB). Only encounter_id (UUID) and
  event_type are included.

Design refs:
    ADR-001  — all ADT events (including WORKFLOW_CANCELLED) published to
               adt-events Pub/Sub topic
    AIR-001  — MLLP ACK within 200ms; dispatcher is post-commit background task
    FR-006   — A11/A12/A13 triggers halt of agent workflows
    NFR-006  — SignalR latency ≤1 second
    TR-015   — best-effort post-commit; failures logged, not fatal
    US-015   — SC-1 (SignalR), Technical Notes (Pub/Sub WORKFLOW_CANCELLED)

```

### 3. Add `publish_raw()` method to `ADTEventPublisher` (minimal extension)

In `hl7-listener/app/pubsub/adt_event_publisher.py` (or the api-gateway equivalent), add a lower-level `publish_raw()` method that accepts pre-built `attributes` and `data` bytes, rather than a full `ADTEvent` object. This decouples `CancellationDispatcher` from the `ADTEvent` domain model.

```python
async def publish_raw(
    self,
    ordering_key: str,
    attributes: dict[str, str],
    data: bytes,
) -> str:
    """Publish a raw Pub/Sub message with pre-built attributes and body.

    Returns:
        The Pub/Sub message ID.
    """
    # same retry + run_in_executor pattern as publish()
    ...
```

### 4. Register `CancellationDispatcher` as a FastAPI dependency

```python
# api-gateway/app/dependencies.py (extend)
from app.services.cancellation_dispatcher import CancellationDispatcher
from app.pubsub.adt_event_publisher import ADTEventPublisher
from app.signalr.hub import SignalRHub

def get_cancellation_dispatcher(
    publisher: ADTEventPublisher = Depends(get_publisher),
    hub: SignalRHub = Depends(get_signalr_hub),
) -> CancellationDispatcher:
    return CancellationDispatcher(publisher=publisher, hub=hub)
```
