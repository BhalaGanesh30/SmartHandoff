"""Pub/Sub publisher for care manager alert notifications.

Publishes `CARE_MANAGER_ALERT` messages to the `notification-requests` Pub/Sub topic
after an appointment is created for a HIGH-risk patient.

Publish pattern: publish-after-commit — the Pub/Sub message is published only after
the DB transaction commits to avoid sending alerts for rolled-back appointments.

Idempotency: the `idempotency_key` field in the payload prevents the Notification
Service from sending duplicate SMS/email if this message is redelivered (AIR-040).

Design refs:
    design.md §7.5 AIR-040 — notification-requests topic; idempotency key
    US-040 AC Scenario 1 — CARE_MANAGER_ALERT payload specification
    ADR-001 — Pub/Sub topic per logical channel (notification-requests)
