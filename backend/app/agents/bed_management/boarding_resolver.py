"""BoardingAlertResolver — resolves active boarding alerts on bed assignment.

Called by ``PATCH /api/v1/beds/{id}/status`` when the new status is RESERVED.
Sets ``boarding_alert_resolved_at`` on the encounter if a boarding alert was
previously sent, stopping future BoardingMonitor cycles from re-detecting it.

No-op if no alert was sent (boarding_alert_sent_at IS NULL) — preserves
correctness for encounters placed before the 2-hour threshold.

Design refs:
    US-038 AC Scenario 2 — no-op when no alert sent (patient placed early)
    US-038 AC Scenario 3 — boarding_alert_resolved_at set on RESERVED assignment
    US-038 TASK-004      — resolve_boarding_alert() implementation
    US-038 DoD           — "Alert resolution on bed assignment event"
