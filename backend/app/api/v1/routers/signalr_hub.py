"""Router: POST /api/v1/signalr/task-updated

Internal broadcast endpoint called by AI agents after each AgentTask status
transition. Validates the payload and delegates to SignalRBroadcaster.

Security:
  - Requires a valid service-to-service JWT (internal scope claim).
  - Not exposed through Cloud Armor to public internet — ingress restricted to
    Cloud Run internal traffic only (VPC connector).

US-022 DoD:
  - POST /api/v1/signalr/task-updated broadcasts to correct groups.
  - Group naming: encounter-{id}, unit-{unitId}, role-{roleName}.
