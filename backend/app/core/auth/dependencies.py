"""Authentication dependencies for FastAPI route protection.

Provides:
  - get_current_internal_service: validates service-to-service JWT for internal endpoints.
  - get_current_staff_user: alias to get_current_user with explicit naming.

US-022 Security:
  Internal endpoints (like POST /api/v1/signalr/task-updated) must be callable
  only by other SmartHandoff services (AI agents) within the VPC. This is enforced
  by a combination of:
    1. Cloud Run ingress: internal-only (blocks public internet traffic).
    2. JWT validation with "scope: internal" claim (validates caller identity).

Internal JWT spec:
    sub     = service name (e.g., "coordinator-agent", "bed-management-agent")
    scope   = "internal"
    iat     = issued-at timestamp (UTC)
    exp     = iat + 1 hour
    alg     = HS256

Signing key:
    Uses the same JWT_SIGNING_KEY as user JWTs (from Secret Manager).
    This is acceptable because the "scope" claim differentiates internal from
    user tokens — the signature validation alone is insufficient for access control.
